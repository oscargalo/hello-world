# hello-world
For ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

IÂ´m from Honduras, and I have two engineering degrees (in ChemEng and Electricity). I know a little bit of codding, and my goal is to have a deeper understanding of computer science, and make my web-based project ideas come to reality.

I love footbal, reading all kinds of books (mostly philosophical literature), psichology, games (mostly Yu Gi Oh! based videogames), playing the guitar and learning new interesting things.
